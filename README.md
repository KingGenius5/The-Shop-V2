THE SHOP

My inspiration for this project was drawn out of the need to get athletes recognized for the good work they do outside of
the respective sport they play. It's a work in progress but I plan on expanding on it. Currently, it works almost like a
regular store where you add store items but rather here you add Players and the "price" is the amount you're willing to
pledge to their charity. I hope to expand it so that it works on both ends (admin and user) and implement some sort of login
and authentication to keep track of the charities you're donating to.
